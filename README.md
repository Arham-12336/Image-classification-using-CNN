# 📷 Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras 🤖

This project showcases a simple image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. It demonstrates how to train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset and make predictions.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow 🧠
- Keras 📦
- NumPy 🧮
- Matplotlib 📊

You can install them using pip:

```shell
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Getting Started 🚀
Clone this Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:Arham-12336/Image-classification-using-CNN-.git
```
Open and Run the Code: Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see how the image classification model is created, trained, and evaluated:
```
jupyter notebook image_classification.ipynb
# or
python image_classification.py
```
Experiment and Customize: Feel free to experiment with the code, modify the neural network architecture, and explore different datasets for image classification.

##Project Structure 📁
The project consists of the following components:

- image_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the image classification code.
- image_classification.py: Python script with the same code as the notebook.
- data/: Directory for storing dataset files.
- models/: Directory for saving trained models.

## Results 📈
The code trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits, achieving an accuracy of approximately 99% on the MNIST test dataset.
